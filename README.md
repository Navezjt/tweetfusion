# TweetFusion

Update your Twitter header image with generative AI.

Powered by [Replicate](https://replicate.com?utm_source=project&utm_campaign=tweetfusion), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.


## How to use it

To run TweetFusion, you'll need a Replicate account and an API key:

##### Get your Replicate token
1. Create a Replicate account at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com?utm_source=project&utm_campaign=replit-node). This is quick and easy, as you can use your existing GitHub account to sign in.
2. Grab your Replicate API token from [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account?utm_source=project&utm_campaign=replit-node)


##### Generate Twitter secrets
Then, you'll need to setup your Twitter API access:
1. Create a free [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com). (Hopefully this is still free by the time you're reading this)
2. Set up User Authentication so your developer account has read and write access:

Choose these settings. For now, use dummy URLs for the OAuth 2.0 and callback URLs.

Save your client keys to a password manager.

3. Next, create an API Key and Secret:

The key will be your `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`, and the secret will be your `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`.

4. Finally, create an Access Token and Secret. Make sure that the permissions say read and write:

The access token will be your `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` and the secret will be your `TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET`.

5. Phew! That was tedious. You should now have all the secrets you need from Twitter.

##### Run!

Now, add all your secrets to your Repl.

If you're running on Replit:
Click the ðŸ”’ **Secrets** button in the Tools sidebar, then secrets for your `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` and `TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET`.

Otherwise, put the secrets in a `.env` file that is .gitignored.

Finally, run it with `npm run start`.
